1. Database - an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system;

Database System - DBMS + database

DBMS - actually an interface between the database and its end users or programs, which allows users to retrieve, update and manage the information.

2. Data integration - uniting data from different sources in one complete system. Actually the mission of this method is to ensure access to the data.

Data Redundancy - a redundant storage of identical data in several places.

3. A transaction is a sequence of operations on a database 
that is executed as a single atomic unit of work. 
It guarantees the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
```
BEGIN;

-- Encounting money from one balance
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE id = 1;

-- Adding money to another balance
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;

```

4. Synchronisation - coordination of concurrent trnasactions
Persistence - The ability of data to outlive the process that created it.

5. Data dictionary - contains data from definition components, provides other components
with this information. It includes tables, indexes, triggers, views, etc...

6. Walmart: + -> Millions of transactions, require reliabitiry, scalability and fast search.
Examination office: + -> you obviously need student info, date of exam, sometimes exam paper to mark
the work. Furthermore grades need to be protected.

webunihelp.com: + -> you need to store info about users, time of message and messages, database is a good choice.

Bruce Sptingsteen: - -> collections to small. It's enough to use Excel instead of DBMS.
