Convert the SQL schema into an ER-schema

a)
Recursive SQL is needed when we need to work with hierarchical structures where one row can refer to another - like employee to manager, manager to superior manager, etc.

Applications:
Management hierarchies (as in this task)
Catalogs/subdirectories
Graph structures
Family trees
```sql
b)SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Id IN (
    SELECT Manager
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Name = 'Paul Meier'
);

c)
SELECT Name
FROM Employees
START WITH Name = 'Paul Meier' --where to start
CONNECT BY PRIOR Id = Manager --who is who's boss
```

```sql
a)
CREATE VIEW cs_faculty_view AS
SELECT *

WHERE course_of_studies = 'computerscience';

b)
create view examination_office_view as
select * from exams;

c)
CREATE VIEW scholarship_commission_view AS
SELECT student, AVG(mark) AS avg_mark
FROM exams
GROUP BY student;

d)
CREATE VIEW dean_statistical_view AS
SELECT course_of_studies, course, date, mark
FROM exams
WHERE date >= current_date - interval '1 year'
  AND date < current_date;
```

```sql
a)

join values v on o.date=v.date;

b)SELECT o.Date AS Order_Date, o.Orders, v.Date AS Value_Date, v.Value
FROM Orders o
JOIN Values v ON o.Date > v.Date;

C)
